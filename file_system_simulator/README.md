This is a software simulation of a file system, some simple file types that may be stored in a file system, 
and a user interface similar to a command prompt or terminal that allows a user to interact with the file 
system and files it contains. Throughout the design and implementation of the file system, I used OOP design 
principles and patterns to ensure the file system is easy to extend with new functionality in the future, 
easy to modify without major code refactoring, and easy to configure with different functionality as needed.
